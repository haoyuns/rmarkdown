# Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse

## Introduction to Modeling
General modeling framework formula:  
$y = f(\overrightarrow{x}) + \epsilon$

- $y$: outcome variable of interest, the phenomenon you wish to model
- $\overrightarrow{x}$: explanatory/predictor variables used to inform your model
- $f()$: function of the relationship between $y$ and $x$ (*the signal*)
- $\epsilon$: unsystematic error component (*the noise*)

### The modeling problem for explanation
$y = f(\overrightarrow{x}) + \epsilon$

1. usually you won't know the true form of $f()$, nor the mechanism that generates the errors $\epsilon$

2. you will know the observations $y$ and $\overrightarrow{x}$, as they are given in our data

3. the goal is to construct or "fit" a model f-hat that approximates $\hat{f}()$ while ignoring $epsilon$

4. **goal restated**: separate the signal from the noise

5. then generate *fitted/predicted* values $\hat{y} = \hat{f}(\overrightarrow{x})$

univariate: only considering one variable at a time

overplotting: adding random jitter `geom_jitter()`

**Correlation coefficient**:  
`cor()`, a summary statistic between -1/1 measuring the strength of linear association of two numerical variables, or the degree to which points fall on a line


### The modeling problem for prediction
Key difference in modeling goals:

1. **Explanation:**  
We care about the form of $\hat{f}()$, in particular any values quantifying relationships between $y$ and $\overrightarrow{x}$

2. **Prediction:**  
We don't care so much about the form of $\hat{f}()$, only that it yields "good" predictions $\hat{y}$ of $y$ based on $\overrightarrow{x}$
