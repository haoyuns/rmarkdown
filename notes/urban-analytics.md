Cities possess both enormous centripetal and centrifugal force that attract people, resources, capital, and ideas, but also propel these same assets outwards.


#### organic data vs. designed data
organic data:
- byproduct of some process like communicating with friends, buying something online or in a store
- usually available at very high frequency
- incapable of measuring margins of error


designed data:
- collected through a carefully designed, statistically robust collection program
- collected at enormous expense, such as census
- capable of measuring margins of error


#### programming languages
- compiled v.s. interpreted
	- compiled: the user types out an entire program and then processes that code through a compiler
	- interpreted: allow the user to type a line of code and immediately execute it in an interpreter


- general purpose v.s. domain specific
	- general purpose: used to implement a wide range of tasks
	- domain specific: designed to address a particular application

- compiled, general purpose: Java, Scala, C++, C
- interpreted, general purpose: Python, Julia, Perl, Ruby
- interpreted, domain specific: R, SQL, JavaScript


#### 数据新闻可以借鉴的阐释
Data are the raw facts or details about a person, place, event, etc.; information comes from transforming and combining data into a more useful form. Data are processed into information in many ways, through maps and visualizations, statistics and models. Although information is our goal, the process of data management is often the most time-consuming part of the analysis workflow. As datasets become larger and larger, data management grows in importance.


#### How are data stored?
- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), UTF-8, etc. Systems converting binary values into human-readable characters (CSV format is one of the most common ASCII file structures)
- XML and JSON
- Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), tables that share keys can be joined dynamically and then queried, all using SQL
- Metadata (data about data)


#### Mapping and GIS process
- generalization: selecting the breadth or depth of features captured and/or displayed, the precision and detail of location or temporal measurements






#### neighborhood effects
Places shape access to opportunity and frame who we are; there is a lengthy history of studies that explore such "neighborhood effects." The enduring influence of place within urban areas, however, also extends beyond residential locations, and includes transitional spaces, such as those occupied through travel, or other collective locations such as workplaces.
