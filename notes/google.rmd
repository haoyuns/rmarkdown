### Thinking analytically

**Data ecosystems**: made up of various elements that interact with one
another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share
data.

#### **Data analysis phases:**

1.  **Ask** questions and define the problem

    -   Define the problem you're trying to solve
    -   Make sure you fully understand the **stakeholder's
        expectations**
    -   Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
    -   Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of
        communication
    -   Take a step back and see the whole situation in **context**
    -   [What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?]{.ul}
    -   [Now that I've identified the issues, how can I help the
        stakeholders resolve their questions?]{.ul}

2.  **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information

    -   What **metrics** to measure
    -   **Locate** data in your database
    -   Create **security** measures to protect that data
    -   [What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?]{.ul}
    -   [What research do I need to do?]{.ul}

3.  **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information

    -   Using spreadsheet functions to find **incorrectly** entered data
    -   Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
    -   Removing **repeated** entries 
    -   Determining if your data is biased
    -   [What **data errors** or **inaccuracies** might get in my way of
        getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to
        solve?]{.ul}
    -   [How can I clean my data so the information I have is more
        consistent?]{.ul}

4.  **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends

    -   Perform calculations
    -   Combine data from multiple sources
    -   Create tables with your results
    -   [What story is my data telling me?]{.ul}
    -   [How will my data help me solve this problem?]{.ul}
    -   [Who needs my company's product or service? What type of person
        is most likely to use it?]{.ul}

5.  **Share** data with your audience

    -   Make better decisions
    -   Make more informed decisions
    -   Lead to stronger outcomes
    -   Successfully communicate your findings
    -   [How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and
        easy to understand?]{.ul}
    -   [What would help me understand this if I were the
        listener?]{.ul}

6.  **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

    -   [How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase
        (step 5) to actually meet the shareholder's needs and
        expectations?]{.ul}

These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into
smaller, manageable parts, which is called **structured thinking**. This
process involves four basic activities:

1.  Recognizing the current problem or situation
2.  Organizing available information 
3.  Revealing gaps and opportunities
4.  Identifying your options

To get the most out of **data-driven decision-making**, it's important
to include insights from people who are familiar with the business
problem. These people are called **subject matter experts**, and they
have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify
any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate
choices being made.

![](daprocess.png){width="800"}

#### **Analytical thinking**

involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using
data in an organized, step-by-step manner.

Five key skills in analytical thinking:

1.  **Curiosity** - a desire to know more about something, asking the
    right questions

2.  **Understanding context** - understanding where information fits
    into the "big picture"

3.  **Having a technical mindset** - breaking big things into smaller
    steps

4.  **Data design** - thinking about how to organize data and
    information

5.  **Data strategy** - thinking about the people, processes, and tools
    used in data analysis

The five key aspects to analytical thinking:

-   visualization
-   strategy
-   problem-orientation
-   correlation
-   big-picture and detail-oriented thinking

**Root cause**: Ask **Five Whys** to reveal the root cause

**Gap analysis**: lets you examine and evaluate how a process works
currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. The
general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now
compared to where you want to be.

#### **Data life cycle:**

-   **Plan** - What plans and decisions do you need to make? What data
    do you need to answer your question?
-   **Capture** - Where does your data come from? How will you get it?
-   **Manage** - How will you store your data? What should it be used
    for, and how do you keep this data secure and protected?
-   **Analyze** - How will the company analyze the data? What tools
    should they use?
-   **Archive** - What should they do with their data when it gets old?
    How do they know when it's time?
-   **Destroy** - Should they ever dispose of any data? If so, when and
    how?

The type of questions you ask as you begin this "deep dive" are very
important. Some common questions are:

-   **Objectives**: What are the goals of this deep dive? What, if any,
    questions are expected to be answered?

-   **Audience**: Who are the stakeholders? Who is interested or
    concerned about the results of this deep dive? Who will you be
    presenting to?

-   **Time**: What is the time frame for completion? By what date does
    this need to be done?

-   **Resources**: What resources are available to accomplish the deep
    dive's goals?

-   **Security**: Who should have access to the information?

### Asking questions

#### SMART questions

-   **Specific**: Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a
    single topic or a few closely related ideas.

-   **Measurable**: Questions can be quantified and assessed.

-   **Action-oriented**: Questions encourage change.

-   **Relevant**: Questions matter, are important, and have significance
    to the problem you're trying to solve.

-   **Time-bound**: Questions specify the time to be studied.

![](dsmart.png){width="800"}

#### Things to avoid when asking questions

Questions should be **open-ended.** This is the best way to get
responses that will help you accurately qualify or disqualify potential
solutions to your specific problem. 

Now, here are some types of questions that you should try to avoid as a
data analyst:

**Leading questions**: questions that only have a particular response

-   [Example]{.ul}: *"This product is too expensive, isn't it?"*

**Closed-ended questions**: questions that ask for a one-word or brief
response only

-   [Example]{.ul}: *"How was the customer trial?"*

**Vague questions:** questions that aren't specific or don't provide
context

-   [Example]{.ul}: *"Does that tool work for you?"*

A better question might be, "When it comes to data entry, how much time
does the tool save you?" This question gives context (data entry) and
helps frame responses that are measurable (time).

**When Creating questions:**

-   Avoid technical jargon.
-   Prioritize your questions: Ask the most important and impactful
    questions first to save time.
-   Make your time count: Stay on subject during the conversation.
-   Clarify your understanding: To avoid confusion, briefly summarizing
    the given answers to make sure you understood it correctly. This
    will go a long way in helping you avoid mistakes.

Take good notes:

-   **Facts**: Any concrete piece of information is usually worth
    writing down. Dates, times, names, and other specifics that pop up.
-   **Context**: Facts without context are useless. Note any relevant
    details that are needed in order to understand the information you
    gather.
-   **Unknowns**: Sometimes you may miss an important question during a
    conversation. Make a note when this happens so you know to figure
    out the answer later.

For example, if we had a conversation with an ice cream shop about
collecting data on customer flavor preferences, our notes might appear
something like this:

-   **Project**: Collect customer flavor preference data.
-   Overall **business goal**: Use data to create more popular flavors.
-   Two **data sources**: Cash register receipts and completed customer
    surveys (email).
-   Target **completion date**: Q2
-   **To do**: Call back later and speak with the manager about the
    location of survey data.

#### Problem Types

Data analysts typically work with six problem types:

1.  Making predictions
2.  Categorizing things
3.  Spotting something unusual
4.  Identifying themes
5.  Discovering connections
6.  Finding patterns

#### Types of dashboards

1.  **Strategic**: Focuses on long term goals and strategies at the
    highest level of metrics
2.  **Operational**: Short-term performance tracking and intermediate
    goals
3.  **Analytical**: Consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in
    these sets

#### Data cycle for spreadsheets

-   **Plan** for the users who will work within a spreadsheet by
    developing organizational standards. This can mean [formatting]{.ul}
    your cells, the headings you choose to highlight, the color scheme,
    and the way you [order]{.ul} your data points. When you take the
    time to set these standards, you will improve communication, ensure
    consistency, and help people be more efficient with their time.

-   **Capture** data by the source by [connecting]{.ul} spreadsheets to
    other data sources, such as an online survey application or a
    database. This data will automatically be updated in the
    spreadsheet. That way, the information is always as [current]{.ul}
    and accurate as possible.

-   **Manage** different kinds of data with a spreadsheet. This can
    involve [storing, organizing, filtering, and updating]{.ul}
    information. Spreadsheets also let you decide who can [access]{.ul}
    the data, how the information is shared, and how to keep your data
    [safe and secure]{.ul}. 

-   **Analyze** data in a spreadsheet to help make better decisions.
    Some of the most common spreadsheet analysis tools include formulas
    to aggregate data or create reports, and pivot tables for clear,
    easy to understand visuals. 

-   **Archive** any spreadsheet that you don't use often, but might need
    to [reference later]{.ul} with built-in tools. This is especially
    useful if you want to store historical data before it gets updated. 

-   **Destroy** your spreadsheet when you are certain that you will
    never need it again, if you have better backup copies, or for legal
    or security reasons. Keep in mind, lots of businesses are required
    to follow certain rules or have measures in place to make sure data
    is destroyed properly.

#### Working with stakeholders

**Stakeholders** are people who have invested time, interest, and
resources into the projects that you are working on.

There are three common stakeholder groups that you might find yourself
working with: the executive team, the customer-facing team, and the data
science team.

![](ddomain.png){width="800"}\

#### Leading great meetings

1.  **Before the meeting**

If you are organizing the meeting, you will probably talk about the
data. Before the meeting:

-   **Identify your objective**. Establish the purpose, goals, and
    desired outcomes of the meeting, including any questions or requests
    that need to be addressed.

-   Acknowledge participants and keep them involved with different
    points of view and experiences with the data, the project, or the
    business.

-   Organize the data to be presented. You might need to turn raw data
    into accessible formats or create data visualizations.

-   Prepare and distribute an agenda. We will go over this next.

2.  **Crafting a compelling agenda**

Here are the basic parts your agenda should include: 

-   Meeting start and end time
-   Meeting location (including information to participate remotely, if
    that option is available)
-   Objectives
-   Background material or data the participants should review
    beforehand

3.  **Sharing your agenda ahead of time**

After writing your agenda, it's time to share it with the invitees.
Sharing the agenda with everyone ahead of time helps them understand the
meeting goals and prepare questions, comments, or feedback.

4.  **During the meeting**

As the leader of the meeting, it's your job to guide the data
discussion. With everyone well informed of the meeting plan and goals,
you can follow these steps to avoid any distractions:

-   Make introductions (if necessary) and review key messages
-   Present the data
-   Discuss observations, interpretations, and implications of the data
-   Take notes during the meeting
-   Determine and summarize next steps for the group 

5.  **After the meeting**

To keep the project and everyone aligned, prepare and distribute a brief
recap of the meeting with next steps that were agreed upon in the
meeting. You can even take it a step further by asking for feedback from
the team.

-   Distribute any notes or data
-   Confirm next steps and timeline for additional actions
-   Ask for feedback (this is an effective way to figure out if you
    missed anything in your recap)

### Preparing data

#### Data formats

-   Primary vs. Secondary
-   Internal vs. External
-   Continuous vs. Discrete
-   Qualitative vs. Quantitative
-   Nominal vs. Ordinal
-   Structured vs. Unstructured

#### **Data modeling**

Data modeling is the process of creating diagrams that visually
represent how data is organized and structured. These visual
representations are called data models. You can think of data modeling
as a blueprint of a house.

**Levels of data modeling**:

1.  **Conceptual** data modeling gives you a high-level view of your
    data structure, such as how you want data to interact across an
    organization
2.  **Logical** data modeling focuses on the technical details of the
    model such as relationships, attributes, and entities.
3.  **Physical** data modeling should actually depict how the database
    was built. By this stage, you are laying out how each database will
    be put in place and how the databases, applications, and features
    will interact in specific detail.

**Basic data modeling techniques:**

-   ER Diagrams
-   UML Class Diagrams
-   a Data Dictionary

1.  **Entity-Relationship modeling** is a default technique for modeling
    and the design of relational (traditional) databases.

**ERDs** work well if you want to design a relational (classic)
database, Excel databases or CSV files. Basically, any kind of tabular
data. They work well for visualization of database schemas and
communication of top-level view of data.

![](https://dataedo.com/asset/img/blog/dataedo_sample_erd.png)

2.  **UML (Unified Modeling Language)** is a standardized family of
    notations for modeling and design of information systems.

You can use class diagrams to design a tabular data (such as in RDBMS),
but were designed and are used mostly for object-oriented programs (such
as Java or C\#).

![](https://dataedo.com/asset/img/blog/uml_class_diagram.png)

3.  **Data dictionaries** are a tabular definition/representation of
    data assets. Data dictionary is an inventory of data sets/tables
    with the list of their attributes/columns.

Data dictionary is suitable as detailed specification of data assets and
can be supplemented with ER diagrams, as both serve slightly different
purpose.
